# 1. Security Objectives

AIFP moves money between machines with no human in the loop. Its security objectives, in priority order:

1. **Integrity of payment proof.** A receipt MUST be unforgeable and tamper-evident. Forging one MUST be cryptographically infeasible.
2. **No double value transfer.** A single logical payment MUST settle at most once; a receipt MUST grant access at most as intended.
3. **No replay.** A captured challenge or receipt MUST NOT be reusable beyond its single intended redemption.
4. **Tight binding.** A receipt MUST be usable only by/for the audience, resource, and amount it was issued for.
5. **Availability under attack.** Local verification MUST keep merchants serving even during backend outage or DDoS.
6. **Confidentiality in transit.** All traffic MUST be encrypted (TLS 1.3); no secret material MUST live inside a receipt.
7. **Least privilege.** Credentials and delegations MUST be narrowly scoped and rotatable.

# 2. Trust Model

```mermaid
flowchart TB
    subgraph Roots["Roots of Trust"]
        ISS[AiFinPay Issuer Key — signs receipts]
        JWKS[(Published JWKS)]
    end
    AGENT[Agent: API key + optional Passport key]
    MERCH[Merchant: API key + JWKS cache]
    CHAIN[Blockchain: settlement finality]
    FIAT[Fiat rails: settlement reference]

```

| Party | Trusted for | NOT trusted for |
|---|---|---|
| **AiFinPay Issuer** | Signing valid receipts; assuming settlement risk for issued receipts | Reading merchant data; holding non-custodial keys |
| **Agent** | Authenticating with its key; paying within budget | Asserting payment without a signed receipt |
| **Merchant** | Verifying receipts; serving resources | Minting receipts; altering claims |
| **Network** | Nothing | Everything — every artifact is signed |

**Root of trust:** the AiFinPay **issuer signing key**, published as a rotating **JWKS**. A merchant trusts a receipt iff it verifies against a current `kid` in that JWKS. Compromise of the issuer key is the catastrophic event the key-management program (Section 11) exists to prevent.

```

Defense in depth: TLS at the edge; WAF/rate-limit before any compute; **local verification** on the data plane (no backend dependency); issuer keys in **HSM/KMS**; append-only **audit log**; idempotency before payment.

# 4. Threat Model (STRIDE + Attack Trees)

## 4.1. STRIDE

| Category | Threat | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|
| **Spoofing** | Forge a receipt | EdDSA over issuer key; `kid`-pinned JWKS; infeasible without issuer private key |
| **Spoofing** | Impersonate an agent | API key + optional Passport Ed25519 signature |
| **Tampering** | Modify claims (amount/resource/aud) | Signature covers all claims; any edit invalidates |
| **Tampering** | Alter webhook | HMAC-SHA256 signature + timestamp |
| **Repudiation** | "I never paid" | On-chain `tx_ref` + signed receipt + append-only audit log |
| **Information disclosure** | Sniff traffic / leak secrets | TLS 1.3; no secrets in receipts; secret-redacting logs |
| **DoS** | Flood challenge/verify | Local verify (cheap), rate limits, anycast, WAF |
| **Elevation** | Replay/reuse receipt | Single-use nonce + idempotency keys |
| **Elevation** | Cross-resource/merchant reuse | `aud` + `resource` binding enforced on verify |

## 4.2. Attack tree — "redeem a receipt I did not pay for"

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    GOAL[Goal: access without paying] --> A[Forge receipt]
    GOAL --> B[Replay valid receipt]
    GOAL --> C[Reuse cross-resource]
    GOAL --> D[Race quota]
    A --> A1[Need issuer priv key -> HSM-protected -> infeasible]
    B --> B1[Need unseen nonce -> nonce store rejects -> 409]
    C --> C1[aud/resource mismatch -> verify rejects -> 422/403]
    D --> D1[Atomic INCR quota -> no race window]
```

Every leaf terminates in a mitigation. There is no path to the goal without compromising the HSM-held issuer key.

---

# 5. Authentication

## 5.1. Two planes

- **Control-plane auth** — API keys (`sk_live_*` secret, `pk_live_*` publishable). Bearer tokens over TLS 1.3. Scoped to merchant or agent. Keys are hashed at rest (Argon2id), shown once, and rotatable.
- **Data-plane auth** — the **Receipt Token** itself authenticates *access*. A valid receipt needs no API key on the retried request.

## 5.2. Agent Passport authentication

Where used, an agent proves identity by signing a challenge with its Passport Ed25519 key (`pp_*`). Delegated sub-agents present a delegation chain signed by the owner. Verification checks signature, scope, and expiry. Passport is optional (AIFP-1 §10.2).

---

# 6. Authorization

Authorization is **capability-based**: possession of a valid, correctly scoped receipt is the capability to access a resource. Verification MUST enforce:

- `aud == merchant_id` (no cross-merchant use) → else `403`.
- `resource == requested resource` (no cross-resource use) → else `422`.
- `amount >= required price` → else `422`.
- `now < exp` → else `402`.
- `nonce` unseen → else `409`.

Independently, a merchant MAY apply **policy authorization** (blocklist `agt_*`, KYC gates, geofencing) returning `403`. Budget authorization on the agent side returns `AIFP-403-BUDGET-EXCEEDED` when a payment would breach policy.

---

# 7. Cryptographic Primitives

| Purpose | Primitive | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Receipt signature | **EdDSA / Ed25519** | Fast verify (~50k/s/core), small sigs, deterministic |
| Receipt encoding | **JWT (JOSE)** / **CWT (COSE)** | Text (JWS) or compact binary (COSE) |
| Webhook signature | **HMAC-SHA256** | Shared secret per merchant; timestamped |
| Transport | **TLS 1.3** | MUST; modern cipher suites only |
| Hashing | **SHA-256 / SHA-512** | Fingerprints, content hashing |
| API key at rest | **Argon2id** | Memory-hard; never store plaintext keys |
| MPC signing | **Threshold Ed25519 / ECDSA** | t-of-n, no single key materializes |
| Randomness | **CSPRNG** | Nonces ≥128 bits from OS CSPRNG |

**Non-goals / disallowed:** no `alg: none`, no HS256 for receipts (asymmetric only so merchants never hold a signing secret), no MD5/SHA-1, no TLS < 1.2 (1.3 REQUIRED for new deployments).

---

# 8. Receipt Token Format & Signature Verification

## 8.1. JWS/JWT receipt

Header:
```json
{ "alg": "EdDSA", "typ": "JWT", "kid": "aifp-2026-06" }
```
Claims (AIFP-1 §7.3): `iss, sub, aud, resource, pricing_tier, amount, currency, asset, chain, tx_ref, receipt_id, nonce, iat, exp`. Default TTL **600 s**.

## 8.2. Verification (normative)

```python
def verify_receipt(token, merchant_id, resource, required_amount, jwks, nonce_seen, mark_nonce):
    header = jwt_header(token)                       # read kid
    key = jwks.get(header["kid"])                    # resolve current key
    if key is None: raise Reject(422, "unknown kid") # may trigger JWKS refresh
    claims = jwt_verify(token, key, alg="EdDSA")     # signature + exp (verifies or raises)
    if claims["iss"] != ISSUER:        raise Reject(422, "bad issuer")
    if claims["aud"] != merchant_id:   raise Reject(403, "wrong audience")
    if claims["resource"] != resource: raise Reject(422, "resource mismatch")
    if float(claims["amount"]) < float(required_amount): raise Reject(422, "amount low")
    if now() >= claims["exp"] - 0:     raise Reject(402, "expired")   # ≤30s skew allowed
    if nonce_seen(claims["nonce"]):    raise Reject(409, "replay")
    mark_nonce(claims["nonce"], ttl=claims["exp"] - now())
    return claims
```

The verification is **pure** except for the nonce store touch. It MUST NOT contact AiFinPay. A failure MUST map to the precise status code so the agent recovers correctly (AIFP-1 §17).

## 8.3. CWT/COSE variant

For constrained agents, the same claim set is encoded as a CBOR Web Token signed with COSE/EdDSA. Verification is identical in logic; the merchant selects the codec by `cty`/capability negotiation.

---

# 9. Replay Protection & Nonce Management

- Every challenge and receipt carries a **single-use nonce**, ≥128 bits from a CSPRNG.
- The merchant maintains a **nonce store** (Redis or sharded in-memory) keyed by nonce with **TTL = receipt TTL** (~600 s). On redemption the nonce is written; a re-presented nonce → `409`.
- Because TTL is short, the store only ever holds nonces from the last few minutes — bounded memory even at billions of receipts/day.
- **Clock skew:** allow ≤30 s tolerance on `exp` to avoid false expiries across hosts; never more.
- **Distributed correctness:** route an agent's receipts to a consistent shard (or use a strongly consistent store) so two concurrent presentations of the same nonce cannot both win. A `SET nonce NX EX ttl` (set-if-absent) is the canonical atomic primitive.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant A as Agent
    participant M as Merchant
    participant N as Nonce store
    A->>M: retry + receipt(nonce=X)
    M->>N: SET n:X 1 NX EX ttl
    alt set succeeded (first use)
        N-->>M: OK
        M-->>A: 200
    else already present (replay)
        N-->>M: nil
        M-->>A: 409
    end
```

---

# 10. Idempotency & Double-Spend Prevention

- **Payment idempotency:** `Idempotency-Key` on `/pay` makes a timed-out retry safe. The Control Plane stores `(api_key, key) → response` for 24 h; identical key+body returns the stored response; same key + different body → `409`. Result: **at-most-once** charge per logical payment.
- **Receipt single-use:** the nonce store guarantees one receipt unlocks one access (unless a multi-use `quota` claim is present).
- **On-chain finality:** `tx_ref` ties a receipt to a settlement transaction, giving non-repudiable proof and preventing a second settlement for the same payment intent.

Together these provide an end-to-end **exactly-once value transfer with at-most-once redemption** guarantee.

---

# 11. Key Management & Rotation

## 11.1. Issuer keys (root of trust)

- Generated and held in **HSM / cloud KMS**; the private key never leaves the boundary. Signing is an API call into the HSM.
- Published as **JWKS** with multiple active `kid`s during overlap windows.

## 11.2. Rotation procedure

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant KMS
    participant JWKS
    participant Merchant
    KMS->>JWKS: publish new key (kid=N+1) alongside kid=N
    Note over Merchant: caches both keys
    KMS->>KMS: start signing with kid=N+1
    Note over JWKS: kid=N kept until all kid=N receipts expire (>=600s)
    KMS->>JWKS: retire kid=N
```

- New receipts sign with the new `kid`; old `kid` stays in JWKS until every receipt it signed has expired (≥ receipt TTL).
- Merchants **MUST** refresh JWKS on encountering an unknown `kid` (with rate-limited backoff to avoid thundering herd).
- **Compromise response:** immediately retire the affected `kid`, publish a revocation, force re-sign, and rotate. Already-expired short-TTL receipts limit blast radius to minutes.

## 11.3. Webhook & API key rotation

Webhook HMAC secrets and API keys support dual-secret rotation (accept old+new during overlap). Keys are revocable instantly from the dashboard.

---

# 12. API Key Security

- Format: `sk_live_*` (secret, server-only), `pk_live_*` (publishable). Test variants `sk_test_*`.
- Stored hashed (Argon2id); never logged or returned after creation.
- Scoped (merchant vs. agent), least-privilege; support IP allow-lists and per-key rate limits.
- **Leak handling:** automated secret-scanning; on detection, auto-revoke and notify. Treat any `sk_*` in client code, logs, or VCS as compromised.

---

# 13. Wallet Security & MPC

| Model | Key custody | Threat posture |
|---|---|---|
| Custodial | AiFinPay HSM | Strong operational security; AiFinPay is trusted custodian |
| Non-custodial | Agent-held | Agent fully responsible; key never sent to AiFinPay |
| **MPC** | t-of-n shares | No single point holds a usable key; tolerates share compromise |

**MPC (recommended for enterprise):** threshold Ed25519/ECDSA splits signing across `n` parties; any `t` cooperate to sign, fewer than `t` learn nothing. No complete private key ever materializes, on any host, at any time. Share refresh (proactive secret sharing) periodically re-randomizes shares without changing the address. Spending policies (per-request/daily caps, allow-lists) are enforced as **pre-sign authorization**, so a compromised share cannot exceed policy.

---

# 14. Smart Contract & Chain Security

- **Payment splitter** (non-custodial): routes protocol fee and multi-party splits atomically; audited; minimal surface; reentrancy-guarded; pull-payment pattern where applicable.
- **mSECCO escrow** (Full Core networks): binds Passport wallets and backs streaming channels; funds released only on signed conditions.
- **Oracle:** **Pyth** price feeds for asset/USD conversion; staleness and confidence-interval checks before using a price.
- **Chain risk:** confirmation-depth policy per chain for high-value resources; re-org awareness; per-network capability tiers (Full Core / Splitter-only EVM / Splitter MVP non-EVM, AIFP-1 Appendix B).
- **Contract upgradeability:** timelock + multisig on any upgradeable component; immutable where possible.

---

# 15. Fiat Settlement Security

- Hybrid fiat/stablecoin settlement via regulated rails (e.g., BVNK). The receipt's `tx_ref` carries the settlement reference.
- **Controls:** sandbox/production isolation, signed settlement callbacks, reconciliation against the ledger, AML/KYC at the rail boundary (applies to merchant payouts, not to per-request agent micropayments).
- **Chargeback/dispute:** `dispute.opened` webhook; AiFinPay assumes settlement risk for issued receipts, so a merchant who served against a valid receipt is not exposed to the agent's funding risk.

---

# 16. Rate Limiting, DDoS & Abuse Prevention

| Layer | Control |
|---|---|
| Edge | Anycast, WAF, SYN/flood protection, geo/ASN heuristics |
| Gateway | Token-bucket per API key + per IP; `429` + `Retry-After`; `RateLimit-*` headers |
| Challenge path | Rate-limited to blunt nonce-harvesting and challenge floods |
| Verify path | Local & cheap by design; not a DoS amplifier (no backend call) |
| Pay path | Idempotency + budget caps bound spend even under abuse |

Because verification is local and stateless, a DDoS against merchants cannot be amplified through AiFinPay, and an AiFinPay outage cannot take down merchant verification.

---

# 17. Fraud Detection & Reputation

- **Signals:** velocity (pays/sec), failed-verify ratio, nonce-replay attempts, chargeback rate, anomalous chain/asset switching, budget-breach frequency.
- **Agent Reputation Network:** `reputation ∈ [0,1000]` (start 500), `risk ∈ [0,100]`, trust levels `untrusted | basic | verified | enterprise`. Reputation rises with successful, dispute-free settlement and falls with fraud/abuse. Merchants MAY require a minimum trust level or apply reputation-based pricing (max −30% discount).
- **Actions:** step-up (require Passport / higher confirmations), throttle, or blocklist (`403`). All automated decisions are logged and appealable via governance.

---

# 18. Monitoring & Audit Logging

- **Audit log:** append-only, tamper-evident (hash-chained) record of payments, receipt issuance/redemption, key rotations, policy changes. Retained per compliance policy.
- **Metrics:** `aifp_verify_fail_total{reason}`, `aifp_replay_blocked_total`, `aifp_402_total`, `aifp_pay_total{status}`, signer latency, JWKS refresh rate, p99 verify latency.
- **Alerting:** spikes in `422`/`409`, JWKS refresh storms, unusual spend velocity, settlement failures.
- **Tracing:** `AIFP-Request-ID` propagated end-to-end for forensics.

---

# 19. Secure Defaults & Security Checklist

**Secure defaults (shipped on):** TLS 1.3; EdDSA-only receipts; `alg:none` rejected; 600 s receipt TTL; mandatory nonce store; 24 h idempotency; budget caps required on agents; secrets hashed (Argon2id); webhooks HMAC-signed + timestamp-checked.

**Implementer checklist:**
```text
[ ] TLS 1.3 enforced everywhere
[ ] Receipts verified locally vs current JWKS (EdDSA), aud+resource+amount+exp+nonce checked
[ ] alg pinned to EdDSA; alg:none and HS* rejected for receipts
[ ] Nonce store present, atomic SET NX EX, TTL = receipt TTL
[ ] Idempotency-Key honored on /pay for 24h
[ ] JWKS cached + refreshed on unknown kid (rate-limited)
[ ] Issuer keys in HSM/KMS; rotation with overlap; compromise runbook ready
[ ] sk_* server-only, hashed at rest, scoped, rotatable; secret scanning on
[ ] Webhooks: verify HMAC + 5-min timestamp window
[ ] Rate limits + WAF on challenge/pay paths
[ ] Budgets enforced pre-sign; AIFP-403-BUDGET-EXCEEDED on breach
[ ] Append-only audit log + metrics + alerting wired
[ ] Degraded mode verified (merchant serves valid receipts during backend outage)
```
